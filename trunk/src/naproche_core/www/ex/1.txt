Axiom.
There is no $y$ such that $y \in \emptyset$.

Axiom.
For all $x$ it is not the case that $x \in x$.

Define $x$ to be transitive if and only if for all $u$, $v$, if $u \in v$ and $v \in x$ then $u\in x$.
Define $x$ to be an ordinal if and only if $x$ is transitive and for all $y$, if $y \in x$ then $y$ is transitive.


Theorem.
$\emptyset$ is an ordinal.

Proof.
Consider $u \in v$ and $v \in \emptyset$. Then there is an $x$ such that $x \in \emptyset$. Contradiction.
Thus $\emptyset$ is transitive.
Consider $y \in \emptyset$. Then there is an $x$ such that $x \in \emptyset$. Contradiction.
Thus for all $y$, if $y \in \emptyset$ then $y$ is transitive. Hence $\emptyset$ is an ordinal.

Theorem.
For all $x$, $y$, if $x \in y$ and $y$ is an ordinal then $x$ is an ordinal.

Proof.
Suppose $x \in y$ and $y$ is an ordinal. Then for all $v$, if $v \in y$ then $v$ is transitive. Hence $x$ is transitive.
Assume that $u \in x$. Then $u \in y$, i.e. $u$ is transitive.
Thus $x$ is an ordinal.
Qed.

Theorem: There is no $x$ such that for all $u$, $u \in x$ iff $u$ is an ordinal.

Proof.
Assume for a contradiction that there is an $x$ such that for all $u$, $u \in x$ iff $u$ is an ordinal.
Lemma: $x$ is an ordinal.
Proof:
Let $u \in v$ and $v \in x$. Then $v$ is an ordinal, i.e. $u$ is an ordinal, i.e. $u \in x$. Thus $x$ is transitive.
Let $v \in x$. Then $v$ is an ordinal, i.e. $v$ is transitive. Thus $x$ is an ordinal. Qed.
Then $x \in x$. Contradiction.
